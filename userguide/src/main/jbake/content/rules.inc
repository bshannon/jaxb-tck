Rules for Products that include Support for Software Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following Rules, in addition to the Rules for {technologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} Products, apply for
each version of an operating system, software component, and hardware platform
Documented as supporting the Product:

*{techID}SD1* For each Product Configuration that causes the Schema Compiler to produce
Schema Compiler Output, the Product must be able to satisfy all applicable
compatibility requirements, including passing all Conformance Tests, except only
as specifically exempted by these Rules.

*{techID}SD2* For each Product Configuration that causes the Schema Compiler to produce
Schema Compiler Output, in cases where such Schema Compiler Output contains
only value classes, that Schema Compiler Output, when combined with the JAXB
Reference Implementation Libraries, must execute properly when run on all J2SE
Reference Runtime versions that correspond to versions of J2SE Documented as
supporting the Product.

*{techID}SD3* The Schema Compiler must not produce Schema Compiler Output from schema
that do not conform to the W3C XML Schema recommendation [XSD Part 1][XSD
Part 2].

*{techID}SD3.1* The Schema Compiler in non-default Product Configurations may produce
Schema Compiler Output when an XML Schema contains constructs for which
a binding has not been defined by the Specification.

*{techID}SD3.2* The Schema Compiler in non-default Product Configurations may produce
Schema Compiler Output when a custom binding declaration is encountered.

*{techID}SD4* The Schema Compiler Output of the Schema Compiler must be either in class
format defined by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Specifications or in source file
format defined by Java Language Specification (JLS).

*{techID}SD5* For each Product Configuration that causes the Schema Generator to produce
Schema Generator Output, the Product must be able to satisfy all applicable
compatibility requirements, including passing all Conformance Tests, except only
as specifically exempted by these Rules.

*{techID}SD6* For each Product Configuration that causes the Schema Generator to produce
Schema Generator Output, the Output of Schema Generator must fully meet W3C
requirements for the XML schema language.

*{techID}SD7* The Schema Generator must not produce Schema Generator Output when a
program element violates mapping constraints defined by Specifications.


*{techID}SD8* The Schema Generator may produce Schema Generator Output when a program
element contains constructs for which a mapping has not been defined by the
Specification.

*{techID}SD9* A schema produced by the Schema Generator from source code containing a
comment or a directive, or from a class file containing non-standard attributes,
must be equivalent to a schema produced by the Schema Generator from the
same source code with the comment or directive removed, or from the class file
with the attributes removed. Two schemas are equivalent if and only if they
validate the same set of XML documents (any XML document is either valid
against both schemas or invalid against both schemas).

*{techID}SD10* Except for tests specifically required by this TCK to be modified (if any) the source
for Schema Compiler and Schema Generator Conformance Tests supplied as part
of the Test Suite or as updated by the Maintenance Lead must be used to certify
compliance.
